# TerraForm

Migrating to AWS using Terraform typically involves creating infrastructure as code (IaC) to provision and manage AWS resources. Below is a simple example of a Terraform script to create an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, and an EC2 instance.

Save the following code in a file (e.g., `aws_migration.tf`), and then run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to apply the configuration.

This Terraform script does the following:

1. Configures the AWS provider with the specified region.
2. Creates a VPC with a CIDR block of `10.0.0.0/16`.
3. Creates a subnet within the VPC with a CIDR block of `10.0.1.0/24` in the specified availability zone (`us-east-1a`).
4. Launches an EC2 instance in the created subnet with a specified AMI and instance type.

Remember to replace the placeholders like `us-east-1`, `ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0`, etc., with your desired values.

After creating the script, follow these steps:

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize your working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to apply the configuration and create AWS resources.
3. Confirm the changes by typing `yes` when prompted.
4. Terraform will output information about the created resources.

This is a basic example, and your migration may involve more resources and configurations based on your specific requirements. Make sure to review and customize the script according to your needs and best practices.
